justify content is along x axis, usually used to get text in middle (a row in a container)
align itens is for y axis, usually used to bring things in the middle vertically (a col in a row)

align items vs align self: https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/a/align-self/
basically align self did a col in row aligned in center of the space that it was given (the entire div was put in center - vertically)


<a href="#" role="button">Button Link</a>
Screen Readers will read this element as “button” instead of “link” -> that's why we put a role tag.

To divide a form into rows, just put a div inside it and apply the form-group and row class to it.
